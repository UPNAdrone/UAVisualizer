# UAVisualizer
UAV Real-time Telemetry Visualizer. UAVisualizer is an efficient, high-fidelity, low-latency, long-range telemetry and flight information transmission and visualization system for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) of any type. The information generated by the flight controller is transmitted through a flexible WebSocket client-server architecture to an Unreal Engine 5-based realistic visualizer that renders the information in real time, including a digital surface model with high-resolution aerial imagery and photogrammetry for almost any terrestrial location. This architecture has been designed with flexibility and scalability at its core, being able to configure different setups depending on the needs and the environment. The scenario combines a global digital elevation model with aerial imagery, 3D photogrammetry for urban areas, and support for custom scenery obtained from photogrammetry and LiDAR mapping.
